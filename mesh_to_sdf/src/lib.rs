//! ⚠️ This crate is still in its early stages. Expect the API to change.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! This crate provides two entry points:
//!
//! - [`generate_sdf`]: computes the signed distance field for the mesh defined by `vertices` and `indices` at the points `query_points`.
//! - [`generate_grid_sdf`]: computes the signed distance field for the mesh defined by `vertices` and `indices` on a grid with `cell_count` cells of size `cell_radius` starting at `start_pos`.
//!
//! ```
//! # use mesh_to_sdf::{generate_sdf, generate_grid_sdf, Topology};
//! let vertices: Vec<[f32; 3]> = vec![[0., 1., 0.], [1., 2., 3.], [1., 3., 4.]];
//! let indices: Vec<u32> = vec![0, 1, 2];
//!
//! let query_points: Vec<[f32; 3]> = vec![[0., 0., 0.]];
//!
//! // Query points are expected to be in the same space as the mesh.
//! let sdf: Vec<f32> = generate_sdf(
//!     &vertices,
//!     Topology::TriangleList(Some(&indices)),
//!     &query_points);
//!
//! for point in query_points.iter().zip(sdf.iter()) {
//!     println!("Distance to {:?}: {}", point.0, point.1);
//! }
//! # assert_eq!(sdf, vec![1.0]);
//!
//! // if you can, use generate_grid_sdf instead of generate_sdf.
//! let bounding_box_min = [0., 0., 0.];
//! let bounding_box_max = [10., 10., 10.];
//! let cell_radius = [1., 1., 1.];
//! let cell_count = [11, 11, 11]; // 0 1 2 .. 10 = 11 samples
//!
//! let sdf: Vec<f32> = generate_grid_sdf(
//!     &vertices,
//!     Topology::TriangleList(Some(&indices)),
//!     &bounding_box_min,
//!     &cell_radius,
//!     &cell_count);
//!
//! for x in 0..cell_count[0] {
//!     for y in 0..cell_count[1] {
//!         for z in 0..cell_count[2] {
//!             let index = z + y * cell_count[2] + x * cell_count[1] * cell_count[2];
//!             println!("Distance to cell [{}, {}, {}]: {}", x, y, z, sdf[index as usize]);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! # assert_eq!(sdf[0], 1.0);
//! ```
//!
//! Indices can be of any type that implements `Into<u32>`, e.g. `u16` and `u32`. Topology can be list or strip. Triangle orientation does not matter.
//! For vertices, this library aims to be as generic as possible by providing a trait `Point` that can be implemented for any type. In a near future, this crate will provide implementation for most common libraries (`glam`, `nalgebra`, etc.). Such implementations are gated behind feature flags. By default, only `[f32; 3]` is provided. If you do not find your favorite library, feel free to implement the trait for it and submit a PR or open an issue.
//!
//! #### Using your favorite library
//!
//! To use your favorite math library with `mesh_to_sdf`, you need to add it to `mesh_to_sdf` dependencies. For example, to use `glam`:
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! mesh_to_sdf = { version = "0.1", default-features = false features = ["glam"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Currently, the following libraries are supported:
//! - `cgmath` (`cgmath::Vector3<f32>`)
//! - `glam` (`glam::Vec3`)
//! - `mint` (`mint::Vector3<f32>` and `mint::Point3<f32>`)
//! - `nalgebra` (`nalgebra::Vector3<f32>` and `nalgebra::Point3<f32>`)
//! - and `[f32; 3]`
//!
//! #### Determining inside/outside
//!
//! As of now, sign is computed by checking the normals of the triangles. This is not robust and might lead to negative distances leaking outside the mesh in pyramidal shapes. A more robust solution is planned for the future.
//!
//! #### Benchmarks
//!
//! [`generate_grid_sdf`] is much faster than [`generate_sdf`] and should be used whenever possible. [`generate_sdf`] does not allocate memory (except for the result array) but is slow. A faster implementation is planned for the future.
